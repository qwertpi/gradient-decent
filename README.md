# gradient-decent
A (simple) python implementation of gradient descent I made to help me understand gradient descent. 
main.py will (by deauault) find the minimum of the function x^2+3x (x squared + 3x) but it is trivial to make it descend any function that you know the derivative and formula of and I have added a few examples of different functions to this repo

## Usage
1\. Modify [function()](https://github.com/qwertpi/gradient-decent/blob/b5cae38163f2476ce5515fbebab849bded75d3a3/main.py#L11) to caluclate the function you are decending
2\. Modify [derivative()](https://github.com/qwertpi/gradient-decent/blob/b5cae38163f2476ce5515fbebab849bded75d3a3/main.py#L11) to caluculate the derivative of the function you are decending
3\. Run the code and reduce the learning rate if it divergies off to infinity instead of converging on the minimum point

# gradient-decent
A (simple) python implementation of gradient descent I made to help me understand gradient descent. As it is main.py will find the minimum of the function x^2+3x (x squared + 3x) but it is trivial to make it descend any function that you know the derivative and formula of and I have added a few examples of different functions to this repo
